### Why

I created this space for you, the biohacker or aspiring biohacker. "Biohacker", is a somewhat confusing and loaded term, but at a super high level, a biohacker is someone who is looking to optimize their performance (both physically and cognitively) through self-experimentation.

I created this space so that you can learn strategies for unlocking your body and mind for optimal performance. Some of the content (things, stuff) that I use in my daily practice may not be available to you, and that's totally fine. They haven't always been available to me either, but the idea is that I want you to optimize for whatever your current situation allows.

### Who

So, who should be a biohacker? Basically anyone with a body and a mind looking to upgrade one or both of those elements.

### What

Biohacking has four fundamental components.

1. Nutrition
> - Fueling your brain and body
2. Recovery
> - Priming your brain and body for optimal performance
3. Cognitive
> - Living and relating from optimal mind
4. Physical
> - Putting your body under stresss in order to trigger a physiological response

I will cover each of these in depth along this journey. 

### Getting Started

***

>> In order to ***optimize***, you have to know what you're starting with.

*** 

### Here is my framework for biohacking.

My framework is based on the Build-Measure-Learn feeback loop used in startup management. The key difference is that for health optimization, you have to `Measure` before the initial build phase.

Start Here üöÄ  
- Measure and test the following things (if you have the available resources):
> - Body Composition
> - Biomarkers
> - Sleep
> - Gut Microbiome
> - DNA

1. Build
- During the build phase, you are creating a protocoal based on the data gathered during the Measure phase.
>- Design the experiment(s)
>- Run the experiment(s)
2. Measure
>- Measure the same things that you initially measured, as well as other metrics that, through discovery, become of interest to you along your journey.
3. Learn
>- This is where you will have to make a decision based on the measurements accumulated: should I `persevere`, or should I `pivot`? Persevere, in this context, means carrying on with the same protocol from your build, while pivot entails changing or shifting some, or all, of the aspects of the protocol.

### Gut Microbiome

I shipped my üí© to `Viome` several weeks ago ... still waiting for my results ‚è≥. Viome identifies and quantifies the living microorganisms in your gut microbiome, analyzes what these organisms are producing, and provides you with personalized nutrition recommendations that help you `optimize your gut microbiome`.

### DNA

I also completed a `DNAfit` test, which I'll share when those results become available. DNAfit claims to help you become the best possible version of yourself. DNAfit promises a smarter, easier and more effective solution to health and fitness, entirely `unique to your DNA profile`. Whatever your goal, DNAfit will ensure you live a longer, happier and healthier life.
