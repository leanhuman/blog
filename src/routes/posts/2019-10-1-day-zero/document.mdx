### Why

I created this space for you, the biohacker or aspiring biohacker. "Biohacker", is a somewhat confusing and loaded term, but at a super high level, a biohacker is someone who is looking to optimize their performance (both physically and cognitively) through self-experimentation.

I created this space so that you can learn strategies for unlocking your body and mind for optimal performance. Some of the content (things, stuff) that I use in my daily practice may not be available to you, and that's totally fine. They haven't always been available to me either, but the idea is that I want you to optimize for whatever your current situation allows.

###  The lowdown

This template is designed with a JAMstack architecture. This means that the blog is statically rendered for the fastest possible load time, but once loaded, it turns into a single page app -- ensuring navigation is silky smooth.

It follows a convention-over-configuation philosophy. It should work out of the box with minimal effort for most people's needs, but can also be configured where required.

Finally, an effort has been made to prefer explicit code over concise code, and simplicity over complexity. Magic is avoided wherever possible, even if this means more code is required for the desired result.


### The tools

- [React](https://reactjs.org) renders the UI
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) converts markdown into React components
- [Navi](https://frontarm.com/navi/) handles routing and creates static HTML files for each route
- [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) builds the app's assets and provides the dev server
