### Why

I created this space for you, the biohacker or aspiring biohacker. "Biohacker", is a somewhat confusing and loaded term, but at a super high level, a biohacker is someone who is looking to optimize their performance (both physically and cognitively) through self-experimentation.

I created this space so that you can learn strategies for unlocking your body and mind for optimal performance. Some of the content (things, stuff) that I use in my daily practice may not be available to you, and that's totally fine. They haven't always been available to me either, but the idea is that I want you to optimize for whatever your current situation allows.

### Who

So, who should be a biohacker? Basically anyone with a body and a mind looking to upgrade one or both of those elements.

### What

Biohacking has four fundamental components.

1. Nutrition
> - Fueling your brain and body
2. Recovery
> - Priming your brain and body for optimal performance
3. Cognitive
> - Living and relating from optimal mind
4. Physical
> - Putting your body under stresss in order to trigger a physiological response

I will cover each of these in depth along this journey. 

### Getting Started

***

>> In order to ***optimize***, you have to know what you're starting with.

*** 

### Here is my framework for biohacking.

My framework is based on the Build-Measure-Learn feeback loop used in startup management. The key difference is that with health and wellness, you have to `Measure` before the initial build phase.

Start Here ðŸš€  
- Measure and test the following things (if you have the available resources):
> - Body Composition
> - Biomarkers
> - Sleep
> - Gut Microbiome
> - DNA

1. Build
- During the build phase, you are creating a protocoal based on the data gathered during the Measure phase.
>- Design the experiment(s)
>- Run the experiment(s)
2. Measure
>- Measure the same things that you initially measured, as well as other metrics that, through discovery, become of interest to you along your journey.
3. Learn
>- This is where you will have to make a decision based on the measurements accumulated: should I `persevere`, or should I `pivot`? Persevere, in this context, means carrying on with the same protocol from your build, while pivot entails changing or shifting some, or all, of the aspects of the protocol.

### Gut Microbiome

This template is designed with a JAMstack architecture. This means that the blog is statically rendered for the fastest possible load time, but once loaded, it turns into a single page app -- ensuring navigation is silky smooth.

### DNA

This template is designed with a JAMstack architecture. This means that the blog is statically rendered for the fastest possible load time, but once loaded, it turns into a single page app -- ensuring navigation is silky smooth.

### Biomarkers

```
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

###  The lowdown

This template is designed with a JAMstack architecture. This means that the blog is statically rendered for the fastest possible load time, but once loaded, it turns into a single page app -- ensuring navigation is silky smooth.

It follows a convention-over-configuation philosophy. It should work out of the box with minimal effort for most people's needs, but can also be configured where required.

Finally, an effort has been made to prefer explicit code over concise code, and simplicity over complexity. Magic is avoided wherever possible, even if this means more code is required for the desired result.


### The tools

- [React](https://reactjs.org) renders the UI
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) converts markdown into React components
- [Navi](https://frontarm.com/navi/) handles routing and creates static HTML files for each route
- [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) builds the app's assets and provides the dev server
