### Why

Two of the most valuable things in life are our time and our energy. Many of us, in the pursuit of fitness, waste a considerable amount of time and energy on things that don't really move the needle. This blog is a set of practices for helping you optimize your performance, both physically and cognitively, while minimizing waste.

This blog is structured as a series of learning milestones. For those of you starting your fitness journey, you should approach each day with the intention of learning about yourself and what works and does not work for you. You do this through self-experimentation, or "biohacking". Biohacking is simply making adjustments to your internal and external environments to function better and more efficently.

This blog is a space where I will use a systems-engineering approach to help you unlock your body and mind for optimal performance and longevity. Some of the content (things, stuff) that I use in my daily practice may not be available to you, and that's totally fine. They haven't always been available to me either, but the idea is that I want you to optimize for whatever your current situation allows.

### Who

So, who should be a biohacker? Basically anyone with a body and a mind looking to upgrade one or both of those elements.

### What

Biohacking has four fundamental components.

1. Nutrition
> - Fueling your brain and body
2. Recovery
> - Priming your brain and body for optimal performance
3. Cognitive
> - Living and relating from optimal mind
4. Physical
> - Putting your body under stresss in order to trigger a physiological response

I will cover each of these in depth along this journey. 

### Getting Started

***

>> In order to ***optimize***, you have to quantify and analyze your baseline.

*** 

### Here is my framework for biohacking.

My framework is based on the Build-Measure-Learn feeback loop used in startup management. The key difference is that for health optimization, you have to `Measure` before the initial build phase.

Start Here 🚀  
- Measure and test the following things (if you have the available resources):
> - Body Composition
> - Biomarkers
> - Sleep
> - Gut Microbiome
> - DNA

1. Build
- During the build phase, you are creating a protocoal based on the data gathered during the Measure phase.
>- Design the experiment(s)
>- Run the experiment(s)
2. Measure
>- Measure the same things that you initially measured, as well as other metrics that, through discovery, become of interest to you along your journey.
3. Learn
>- This is where you will have to make a decision based on the measurements accumulated: should I `persevere`, or should I `pivot`? Persevere, in this context, means carrying on with the same protocol from your build, while pivot entails changing or shifting some, or all, of the aspects of the protocol.

#### Body Composition Analysis Explained

> Starting from the top, you have `Intracellular Water` (ICW )and `Extracellular Water` (ECW). Intracellular Water is the amount of body water held within the body’s cells; Extracellular Water is the water outside the cells. Added together, these make up Total Body Water. Both of these sections are useful in their own right, but monitoring Extracellular Water in particular provides a lot of value. If there's an increase in ECW, but not ICW, this could be the presence of internal swelling and/or `inflammation`.

> Below ICW and ECW is `Dry Lean Mass` (DLM). This is the weight of the protein and mineral content in the body. Because muscle is made up of mostly protein, and because DLM by definition doesn't account for body water, if there's an increase in DLM, it's very likely that you have truly gained muscle.

> Below DLM is `Body Fat Mass`. This reports all of my body fat, including both the surface level (subcutaneous) and internal (visceral) fat.

> By adding ICW, ECW, and DLM together, you get the total `Lean Body Mass` (LBM), shown in the fourth column. LBM is the weight of everything in the body that is not body fat. This includes muscle, water, bones, organs - everything
that is not Body Fat. 

> Most of the time, increases in LBM reflect increases in muscle (which you can also see as an increase in DLM), and is considered a positive improvement in body composition. However, people who do not maintain normal body water ratios may
have increased LBM due to swelling caused by certain health conditions.

### Muscle-Fat Analysis 

```
                           | Value       |
-------------------------- | ----------- |
Weight (lbs)               | 172.4       |
Skeletal Muscle Mass (lbs) | 93.9        |
Body Fat Mass (lbs)        | 10.6        |
```

#### Muscle-Fat Analysis Explained

##### WEIGHT
>- Total Body Weight

##### SKELETAL MUSCLE MASS (SMM)
>- The total weight of your Skeletal Muscle. These are the muscles that can be `grown and developed through exercise`. Unlike LBM, which includes everything that isn’t body fat, you can view an increase in SMM as actual muscle gain.


##### BODY FAT MASS
>- This is how much body fat you have, and combines both the `surface level and internal fat`. The Muscle-Fat Analysis also tells you whether you have a healthy balance of SMM and Body Fat Mass with respect to your weight.

### Obesity Analysis 

```
                           | Value       |
-------------------------- | ----------- |
BMI                        | 22.8        |
Percent Body Fat           | 6.1         |
```

#### Obesity Analysis Explained

> The Obesity Analysis includes the signature metric of any body composition analysis: Percent Body Fat (PBF). It’s a deceptively simple metric – a division of body fat mass by total weight – but `it is a much better indicator of the risk of obesity than BMI`, which is one of the major reasons BMI is still included in the analysis – to highlight its flaws by comparing it to PBF.

### Segmental Lean Analysis

```
                          | Value       | ECW/TBW    |
-------------------------   ----------- | ---------- |                                 
Right Arm            (lbs)| 9.85        |   0.367    |
                       (%)| 123.0       |            |
-----------------------------------------------------|
Left Arm             (lbs)| 9.85        |   0.371    |
                       (%)| 123.1       |            |
-----------------------------------------------------|
Trunk                (lbs)| 72.4        |   0.365    |
                       (%)| 113.3       |            |
-----------------------------------------------------|
Right Leg            (lbs)| 24.63       |   0.357    |
                       (%)| 110.6       |            |
-----------------------------------------------------|
Left Leg             (lbs)| 24.52       |   0.363    |
                       (%)| 110.2       |            |
```

#### Segmental Lean Analysis Explained

##### Lean Body Mass vs. Muscle Mass
> In order to fully understand this section, you must fully understand what it is not. The information in the Segmental Lean Analysis shows how much `Lean Body Mass` is contained in each segment; not how much “muscle” is in each segment.
While it is true that Skeletal Muscle gains in a body segment will be reflected as gains in the Segmental Lean Analysis chart, `not every gain in Lean Body Mass can be explained by muscle`. That’s because Lean Body Mass also accounts for body water. This makes this chart useful not just for tracking muscle, but also for injury and disease states.

> The body is divided into `5 body segments`: the two arms, two legs, and the trunk, which can be thought of as covering the area between the neck and legs. The information for each body segment is reported as two numbers. The top number shows how much Lean Body Mass in pounds is in a given segment. The bottom number compares Lean Body Mass against measured body weight. This shows whether or not you have enough Lean Body Mass to support your own body weight, where 100% = sufficient. This analysis allows me to determine if there are any muscular imbalances as well.

### ECW/TBW Analysis 

```
                           | Value       |
-------------------------- | ----------- |
ECW/TBW                    | 0.364       |
```

#### ECW/TBW Analysis Explained

> The ECW/TBW Analysis compares the ratio of ECW to TBW. Most healthy people will have an average ratio of around 0.380, with the `acceptable range
being between 0.360 – 0.390`. Anything beyond 0.390 may indicate swelling or excess ECW (often seen in obese individuals). Thise measurement also gives context to LBM. High LBM and a high ECW/TBW ratio usually indicate the presence of excess body water – not just muscle.

### Visceral Fat Level
`Level 1 [Low]`

>- There are two main types of body fat: subcutaneous and visceral. The Visceral Fat level shows how much harmful visceral fat
you have.

### Gut Microbiome

I shipped my 💩 to `Viome` several weeks ago ... still waiting for my results ⏳. Viome identifies and quantifies the living microorganisms in your gut microbiome, analyzes what these organisms are producing, and provides you with personalized nutrition recommendations that help you `optimize your gut microbiome`.

### DNA

I also completed a `DNAfit` test, which I'll share when those results become available. DNAfit claims to help you become the best possible version of yourself. DNAfit promises a smarter, easier and more effective solution to health and fitness, entirely `unique to your DNA profile`. Whatever your goal, DNAfit will ensure you live a longer, happier and healthier life.

```

Here's the message that I received from my doctor after receiving my Lipid Panel:

"Your lab tests are normal except for very severely `elevated cholesterol`. This may be related to your diet experimentation or it may be genetically high cholesterol or both. I recommend rebalancing your diet toward low-fat, with plenty of vegetables, and coming to see me in 3 months to recheck."

Here's what's happening:

>- Typically on a `low-carb diet` (in this case, I had been on a Carnivore diet for the three months leading up to my test), your LDL is going to be a bit high. Mine is quite high, however, I don't believe it is a cause for concern because my `HDL is high`, indicating a strong metabolic status, and my `Triglycerides are low`, suggesting that they are being utilized correctly.

##### Metabolic Panel Explained

Here's the message that I received from my doctor after receiving my Metabolic Panel:

"Your lab tests are normal except for `borderline elevated sugar (prediabetes)`.

`For what it's worth, the ability of current tests (fasting or nonfasting) to diagnose prediabetes is somewhat in question`, so please simply work on being healthy and don't focus on the number too much."

Here's what's happening:

>- For people who are doing low carb long term, the majority will find that their fasting blood glucose becomes their highest value of the day. They are not actually having issues with blood sugar. They are doing really well. The scientific name is `physiologic insulin resistance` and it’s a good thing — unlike `pathologic insulin resistance.` The “pathologic” kind of insulin resistance is caused by higher and higher levels of insulin — hyperinsulinemia — trying to force glucose into over-stuffed cells. That insulin resistance is a prominent feature of type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and other chronic conditions. In my case, while doing a Carnivore diet, the glucose is coming from gluconeogenesis - the creation of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids from proteins. I'll admit that my protein intake was probably higher than optimal while on Carnivore, however, gluconeogenesis is a natural protective process that got homo sapiens through hundreds of thousands of years of feasts and famines.
