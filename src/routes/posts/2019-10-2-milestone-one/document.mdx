These are the hacks that I use on a weekly basis. My protocol focuses mostly on recovery and cognitive performance with a couple days of performance enhancement. 

# A.I. Adaptive Cardio

The world’s shortest cardio workout that gives you the benefits of a 40-minute jog in `40 SECONDS of effort`. This artificial intelligence enhanced stationary bike learns your body and automatically adapts to give you the perfect workout for your body every time.

# Atmospheric Cell Trainer

A comfortable, futuristic pod that uses changes in air pressure to create a workout for your `cellular energy system`.

# The Big Squeeze

A full body `detox` massage and lymphatic drainage technology.

# Breathe EZ

Specially charged EZ water vapor that turbocharges your `cellular repair process`.

# The Cheat Machine

The Cheat Machine uses `adaptive resistance technology` to push you harder than you could ever push yourself, giving you a week’s worth of weightlifting in under fifteen minutes.

# Cold HIIT 

Cold HIIT combines `compression and cooling technology`, helping you make dynamic strength gains and accelerate recovery in a twenty-minute, high-intensity workout.

# Cryotherapy

Cryotherapy is the science of exposing the body to sub-zero temperatures of up to `-220°F` in order to stimulate multiple physical and mental health benefits.

# EEG Brain Trainer

The EEG Brain Trainer is a meditation, focus, and “presence” trainer for the brain. This modality influences the brain to become more present in each moment without letting your mind unconsciously wander or be distracted by internal or external stimuli, and allows you to gain `access to peak mental performance`.

# Infrared Sauna

Full body, full spectrum infrared sauna combined with color therapy to `increase cell health, decrease stress and beautify skin`.

# Oxygen Trainer

The Oxygen Trainer combines low (hypoxic) and high oxygen (hyperoxic) exposure while riding at an aerobic pace in order to super-saturate as well as temporarily deprive oxygen to the cells. It’s excellent for allowing the cells to `produce energy more efficiently` as well as clear out any scar tissue or waste that slows down the major systems and organs of the body.

# Ozone Sauna

Surrounding you in Ozone while also `hyper-oxygenating` the body from the neck down to detoxify, release muscular tension, and improve the immune system.

# PEMF

Imagine your body as a battery — daily stressors slowly drain your body of its energy to function optimally. By the end of the day, you’re mentally, physically, and emotionally depleted. That’s where PEMF technology comes in! Pulsed Electro-Magnetic Fields is a soothing and energetic modality that `re-energizes your internal battery`.

# REDcharger

Low-level light therapy has been shown to help the body heal itself by stimulating its natural ability for `regeneration and repair`. This 40-minute full-body treatment is designed to treat every area of your body delivering health and wellness in a non-invasive, natural way.

# Virtual Float Tank

Hack your brain into a `meditative theta-wave state`, providing deep relaxation and clarity.
